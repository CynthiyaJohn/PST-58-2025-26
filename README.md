# 🧠 PST 2025–26 | Flowgorithm Practice

This repository contains my **Problem Solving Techniques (PST)** practice work for the academic year **2025–2026**, implemented using **Flowgorithm**.

The focus of this repository is on building **strong logical thinking**, **step-by-step problem solving**, and **clear algorithm design** through flowcharts.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice core **problem-solving logic**
- Visualize algorithms using **flowcharts**
- Strengthen fundamentals before coding
- Maintain a structured academic practice record
- Track continuous improvement over time

This repository represents **practice, not projects** — and that is intentional.

---

## 🛠️ Tool Used

- **Flowgorithm**
  - Flowchart-based algorithm design
  - Step-by-step execution
  - Language-independent logic building

---

## 🗂️ Contents

The repository includes problems such as:

- Basic input/output problems
- Conditional logic (if / else)
- Loop-based problems
- Mathematical computations
- Pattern and sequence logic
- Beginner algorithm design exercises

Each problem is represented as a **Flowgorithm (.fprg) file**.

---

*(Folders and files will be updated as practice progresses.)*

---

## 📌 Notes

- Problems are solved **step-by-step**
- Emphasis is on **logic clarity**, not optimization
- Flowcharts are designed to be **easy to understand and explain**
- This repository will grow gradually with more problems

---

## 📅 Academic Context

- **Subject:** Problem Solving Techniques (PST)
- **Year:** 2025–2026
- **Program:** B.E. Computer Science & Engineering
